# Camera2MediaCodec
Android Video Recording with Camera2, MediaCodec and GLSurfaceView

There is nothing new in the code. I've mixed existing [Google's Camear2Video sample](https://github.com/android/camera-samples/blob/master/Camera2Video) and [Google's CameraCaptureActivity from experimental repo Grafika](https://github.com/google/grafika/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/android/grafika/CameraCaptureActivity.java) to support Camera2 API

Sample might help anyone who is willing to apply their own video effects using OpenGL and then preview it to user and record video into the file.
